📄 DocuReader
=============

DocuReader is a dual-purpose web application built with Flask. The repository contains two applications:

1.  **Q&A Application** (`qna-from-doc`): 🧑‍💻 Allows users to upload a PDF document and ask questions based on its content. Uses OpenAI's GPT-4 API to generate responses.
2.  **PDF Viewer Application** (`docmaker`): 📑 Allows users to upload a PDF containing structured data (a list of hospitals) and view the extracted data in a table format. Also includes a script to generate a sample PDF of hospital data for testing.

🌟 Features
-----------

-   **Q&A Application**: Upload PDF, ask questions, and get answers based on document content.
-   **PDF Viewer Application**: Upload a structured PDF, extract data, and view it in a table format.
-   **PDF Generator**: Generate a dummy hospital data PDF for testing the PDF Viewer Application.

⚙️ Prerequisites
----------------

-   **Python**: Version 3.8+
-   **OpenAI API Key**: Required for the Q&A Application. Sign up [here](https://platform.openai.com/) for an API key.
-   **Virtual Environment**: Recommended for managing dependencies

* * * * *

🚀 Installation
---------------

1.  **Clone the Repository**

    bash

    Copy code

    `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DocuReader.git
    cd DocuReader`

2.  **Install Dependencies**

    bash

    Copy code

    `pip install -r requirements.txt`

3.  **Set Up Environment Variables**\
    For the Q&A app, you'll need an OpenAI API key.

    -   Create a `.env` file or set the environment variable directly in your terminal:

    bash

    Copy code

    `export OPENAI_KEY='your_openai_api_key'`

🏃 Running the Applications
---------------------------

Each application is independent and needs to be started separately.

### 1️⃣ Q&A Application

This application allows you to upload a PDF and ask questions based on the document content.

-   **Navigate to the Application Directory**

    bash

    Copy code

    `cd qna-from-doc`

-   **Run the Application**

    bash

    Copy code

    `python app.py`

-   **Access the Application**\
    Open your browser and go to [http://127.0.0.1:5000](http://127.0.0.1:5000/).

### 2️⃣ PDF Viewer Application

This application allows you to upload a PDF with structured data (e.g., a list of hospitals) and view the data in table format.

-   **Navigate to the Application Directory**

    bash

    Copy code

    `cd docmaker`

-   **Generate Sample PDF (Optional)**\
    To generate a PDF with sample hospital data for testing, run:

    bash

    Copy code

    `python docmaker.py`

-   **Run the Application**

    bash

    Copy code

    `python app.py`

-   **Access the Application**\
    Open your browser and go to [http://127.0.0.1:5000](http://127.0.0.1:5000/).

🖥️ Usage
---------

### 💬 Q&A Application

1.  Upload a PDF document via the "Upload a PDF Document" form.
2.  Once uploaded, enter a question in the "Ask a Question Based on the Document" form.
3.  The application will query the OpenAI API and display an answer based on the document content.

### 🗂️ PDF Viewer Application

1.  Upload a structured PDF document (e.g., the sample PDF generated by `docmaker.py`).
2.  The app will extract data and display it in a table format on the page.

⚠️ Risks & Disclaimers
----------------------

-   **API Costs**: 🤑 Using the OpenAI API may incur costs. Monitor your usage on OpenAI's platform to avoid unexpected charges.
-   **Privacy**: 🔒 Documents uploaded are processed locally, but data sent to OpenAI for question answering is subject to OpenAI's privacy and data usage policies.
-   **Accuracy**: 📉 While GPT-4 provides robust answers, its responses may not always accurately reflect the document content, especially with complex or nuanced text.
-   **PDF Compatibility**: 📄 Not all PDFs may be processed correctly, especially those with non-standard formatting or images instead of text.

* * * * *

💡 Troubleshooting
------------------

-   **API Key Error**: Ensure the OpenAI API key is correctly set in the environment variable `OPENAI_KEY`.
-   **Dependencies**: If you encounter issues with dependencies, double-check the `requirements.txt` file and ensure you have the correct versions installed.
-   **File Upload Issues**: Ensure your file is a valid PDF and under any file size limits set by Flask.
