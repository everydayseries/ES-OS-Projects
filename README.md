# ES-OS-Projects
✨ _Everyday Series Open Source_ — a playground of community-built utilities, prototypes, and experiments.

## 🎉 Where it all began
Almost two years ago we kicked off a playful challenge: could we **vibe-code** in English first, let the community vote, and only then touch the code? Meetups (see [meetup.com/everydayseries](https://meetup.com/everydayseries)) became our whiteboard; livestreams captured the chaos; and every outcome landed right here so anyone could remix it.

## 🚀 Vibe coding → Mature shipping
That scrappy energy has evolved. Today we draft with Codex, brainstorm flows with Lovable, and sanity-check builds with Claude Code. The result? Sharper utilities, better documentation, and a repo that now doubles as a production-ready toolbox. Everything ships under the MIT License, so feel free to fork, embed, or productize.
